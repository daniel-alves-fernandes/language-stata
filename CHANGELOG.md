  - Color parentheses forming capture groups
  - In regular `regexm()`, color as illegal any group starting with `*`, `?`, or `+`.
  - Color lookaheads and lookbehinds in `ustrregexm()`

## [1.0.4] - 2017-10-02

  ```

- Started CHANGELOG! Hopefully will go back and fill out previous revisions' edits.

### Fixed
- Regex highlighting error that colored capturing groups wrong
